# Run-Passionfruit-As-Node-Project
If you are someone who cannot `npm i -g passionfruit` as well, you can now run it on a local project like a real man.

## Installation
1. Pull this project
2. Change directory to the already pulled git project
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run start`
5. Plug your jail broken devices and go to `http://localhost:31337`

## About
